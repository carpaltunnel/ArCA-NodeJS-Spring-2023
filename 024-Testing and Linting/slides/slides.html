<!--
    This is the core element used by impress.js: the wrapper for your presentation steps. 
    In this element all the impress.js magic happens.
    
    data-transition-duration sets the time in microseconds that is used for the
    animation when transtitioning between slides.
    
    The width, height, scale and perspective options define a target screen size that you should
    design your CSS against. impress.js will automatically scale all content to different screen
    sizes. See DOCUMENTATION.md for details. Below, I have targeted full HD screen resolution.
    
    data-autoplay can be used to set the time in seconds, after which presentation
    automatically moves to next slide. It can also be set individually for each
    slide, but here we just set a common duration for all slides.

<div id="impress"
    data-transition-duration="1000"

    data-width="1920"

    data-perspective="1000"

    <!--
        Each step of the presentation should be an element inside the `#impress` with a class name
        of `step`. These step elements are positioned, rotated and scaled by impress.js, and
        the 'camera' shows them on each step of the presentation.
        
        The `id` attribute of the step element is used to identify it in the URL, but it's optional.
        If it is not defined, it will get a default value of `step-N` where N is a number of slide.
        This step is auto-assigned the id "step-1". You can also use `#step-1` in a link, to 
        point directly to this particular step.
        
        Positioning information is passed through data-* attributes.
        
        In the example below we only specify x and y position of the step element with `data-x="-1000"`
        and `data-y="-1500"` attributes. This means that **the center** of the element (yes, the center)
        will be positioned in point x = -1000px and y = -1500px of the presentation 'canvas'. It will not 
        be rotated or scaled.
        
        The "step" class is what *must* be used for every "slide". In this example we also use the "slide"
        class, which adds a rectangle with some background and makes this presentation look like a traditional
        powerpoint slide show. The "slide" class is entirely optional and indeed you wouldn't use it for
        your cooler impress.js presentations.

        <h1>Testing and Linting</h1>
        <br /><br />
        <br /><br />
        <p>ESLint, Assert, Mocha, Chai, and Sinon are testing frameworks and tools that allow to prove your code works by exhaustively testing it. They help facilitate Test Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD) by creating test cases that your code must satisfy, then demonstrating that it does.</p>

    <div id="eslint" class="step slide" data-rel-x="2200" data-rel-y="0">
        <h1>ESLint</h1>
        <p>ESLint detects and recommends fixes to common mistakes and style errors. These range from things that are deprecated like var usage and simple code style recommendations like suggesting that every file should end with a new line. AirBnB publishes a commonly used ESLint definition that we'll be using.  There's also a <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint">VS Code Extension</a></p>

    <div id="assert" class="step slide" data-rel-x="2200" data-rel-y="0">
        <h1>Assert</h1>
        <p>Assert is a Node.js core module that provides assertion functions for verifying expressions. When a test returns false, asserts throws an error to stop execution which can bubble up to Mocha, Chai, etc. Because it is a core module, no dependency is required but you do need to require() it in your script.
            Use the <code>strict</code> version.
        </p>

            <li><code>assert(expr)</code> - Evaluate expr for truthy value</li>
            <li><code>assert.equal(x, y)</code> - Assert that x === y</li>
            <li><code>assert.notEqual(x, y)</code> - Assert that x !== y</li>
            <li><code>assert.deepEqual(q, z)</code> - Assert that q deep equals z</li>

        <h1>Mocha</h1>
        <p>Mocha is a robust testing framework that we can use to write comprehensive yet readable test suites for our code. Tests are typically grouped by file, class, and function with both positive and negative tests. When executed, the tests will provide a list of correct and incorrect results that are easy to read and understand. It is commonly paired with assert and / or chai for determining the results of tests.</p>

        <pre><code class="javascript">describe('OurClass', () => {
    describe('function1', () => {
        it('should return true', () => {
            assert(OurClass.function1(), true);

        <h1>Mocha + ESLint</h1>
        <br />
        <p>By default, ESLint won't be aware of Mocha and will flag your test functions as undefined.  Add the following to your <code>.eslintrc.json</code></p>

        <h1>Mocha Hooks</h1>
        <p>There are four main lifecycle hooks you can use to do work and cleanup before/after your tests execute </p>

        <ol>
            <li>beforeAll - Invoked before any of your tests execute</li>
            <li>beforeEach - Invoked before every test</li>
            <li>afterEach - Invoked after every test</li>
            <li>afterAll - Invoked after all tests have executed</li>

    <div id="mocha-async" class="step slide" data-rel-x="2200" data-rel-y="0">
        <h1>Mocha + Async</h1>
        <p>In the past you would include a done() function for testing asynchronous code. But, for awhile now Mocha has supported native Promises so you can simply return a promise and the test will run until it has resolved (passed) or rejected (failed).

        You might also be interested in "Chai as Promised" for asynchronous assertions.</p>

    <div id="chai" class="step slide" data-rel-x="2200" data-rel-y="0">
        <h1>Chai</h1>
        <p>Chai is a framework that provides more natural language friendly assertions. There are three main interfaces that have the same effect but with a different layout - should(), expect(), and assert(). I always use expect() but you can get the same behavior out of all of them.</p>

        <pre><code class="javascript">// Assert
assert(typeof myVar === 'string')

// Chai
expect(myVar).to.be.a('string');

        <h1>NPM + ESLint + Mocha</h1>

    <!-- This last, empty "slide" is set to be very large using the data-scale attribute, 
         so that it covers all the other slides you just saw. 
         It's a common way of zooming out at the end, to show the whole presentation.
         In CSS, we set pointer-events:none to make this slide non-clickable. 
         It makes a difference at least for SVG content, such as the mermaid diagram. -->
