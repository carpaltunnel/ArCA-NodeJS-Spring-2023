    This is the core element used by impress.js: the wrapper for your presentation steps. 
    In this element all the impress.js magic happens.
    
    data-transition-duration sets the time in microseconds that is used for the
    animation when transtitioning between slides.
    
    The width, height, scale and perspective options define a target screen size that you should
    design your CSS against. impress.js will automatically scale all content to different screen
    sizes. See DOCUMENTATION.md for details. Below, I have targeted full HD screen resolution.
    
    data-autoplay can be used to set the time in seconds, after which presentation
    automatically moves to next slide. It can also be set individually for each
    slide, but here we just set a common duration for all slides.

    <!--
        Each step of the presentation should be an element inside the `#impress` with a class name
        of `step`. These step elements are positioned, rotated and scaled by impress.js, and
        the 'camera' shows them on each step of the presentation.
        
        The `id` attribute of the step element is used to identify it in the URL, but it's optional.
        If it is not defined, it will get a default value of `step-N` where N is a number of slide.
        This step is auto-assigned the id "step-1". You can also use `#step-1` in a link, to 
        point directly to this particular step.
        
        Positioning information is passed through data-* attributes.
        
        In the example below we only specify x and y position of the step element with `data-x="-1000"`
        and `data-y="-1500"` attributes. This means that **the center** of the element (yes, the center)
        will be positioned in point x = -1000px and y = -1500px of the presentation 'canvas'. It will not 
        be rotated or scaled.
        
        The "step" class is what *must* be used for every "slide". In this example we also use the "slide"
        class, which adds a rectangle with some background and makes this presentation look like a traditional
        powerpoint slide show. The "slide" class is entirely optional and indeed you wouldn't use it for
        your cooler impress.js presentations.

        <h1>Promises</h1>
        <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
        <p>So we've established that nobody wants to deal with callback hell.  Let's look at the alternative - Promises.</p>

    <div id="promises" class="step slide" data-rel-x="2200" data-rel-y="0">
      <h2>What is a promise?</h2>
      <p>Promises are asynchronous functions that "promise" to notify you when their work is done and do not block the event loop. The completion can be a success (resolve) or an error (reject).</p>
      <br />
      <p>Since full featured Promises are somewhat new to Node.js core (Promise.allSettled() was only added in v12, though basic functionality has been around longer), we'll briefly cover two third party libraries that filled the gap while the Node.js Promise core was under development.</p>

    <h1><a href="https://github.com/kriskowal/q">Q</a></h1>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/kriskowal/q">Q</a> is a third party Promise library that was intended to provide full promise functionality faster than it could be integrated into the Node.js core.</p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">const Q = require('q');
const fiveSecondPromise = (seconds) => {
    const deferred = Q.defer();
    setTimeout(deferred.resolve, seconds * 1000);
    return deferred.promise;
};

fiveSecondPromise(5).then(() => {
    console.log('Looks like it\'s been five seconds...');

    <h1>Important async/await Notes</h1>
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li><code>await</code> is only valid inside of a code block defined with <code>async</code>.</li>
        <li>Functions being "await"ed must return a Promise</li>
        <li>Looks like synchronous code but is inherently asynchronous</li>
        <li>Just like all other promise usage, it does not block the event loop</li>
        <li>No promise chain</li>
        <li>Therefore, no <code>.catch()</code> - use <code>try/catch</code> (next slide)</li>

</div>

<div id="try-catch" class="step slide" data-rel-x="2200" data-rel-y="0">
    <h1><code>try/catch</code></h1>
    <p><code>try</code> lets you "try" a block of code.  If an exception occurs, the <code>try</code> block terminates and execution moves to the <code>catch</code> block.
    This allows you to handle runtime exceptions rather than crashing your code.</p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">try {
    console.log('I\'m about to throw an exception...');
    throw new Error('Told you so');
    console.log('I\'ll never execute due to the exception above : (');

<div id="try-catch-continued" class="step slide" data-rel-x="2200" data-rel-y="0">
    <h1><code>try/catch Continued</code></h1>

    <pre><code class="javascript">try {
    console.log('I\'m about to throw an exception...');
    console.iDoNotExist('test');

<div id="finally" class="step slide" data-rel-x="2200" data-rel-y="0">
    <h1><code>finally</code>...</h1>
    <p>The <code>finally</code> block executes after a <code>try/catch</code> regardless of the outcome.  This is handy for cleaning up resources (like DB connections) in a single place that you'd need to do whether the <code>try</code> succeeds or errors.</p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">// Finally without exception
try {
    console.log('No exceptions here.');
} catch (ex) {
    console.error(`Error!  An exception was thrown with value : ${ex}`);
