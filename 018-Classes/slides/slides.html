    This is the core element used by impress.js: the wrapper for your presentation steps. 
    In this element all the impress.js magic happens.
    
    data-transition-duration sets the time in microseconds that is used for the
    animation when transtitioning between slides.
    
    The width, height, scale and perspective options define a target screen size that you should
    design your CSS against. impress.js will automatically scale all content to different screen
    sizes. See DOCUMENTATION.md for details. Below, I have targeted full HD screen resolution.
    
    data-autoplay can be used to set the time in seconds, after which presentation
    automatically moves to next slide. It can also be set individually for each
    slide, but here we just set a common duration for all slides.

        Each step of the presentation should be an element inside the `#impress` with a class name
        of `step`. These step elements are positioned, rotated and scaled by impress.js, and
        the 'camera' shows them on each step of the presentation.
        
        The `id` attribute of the step element is used to identify it in the URL, but it's optional.
        If it is not defined, it will get a default value of `step-N` where N is a number of slide.
        This step is auto-assigned the id "step-1". You can also use `#step-1` in a link, to 
        point directly to this particular step.
        
        Positioning information is passed through data-* attributes.
        
        In the example below we only specify x and y position of the step element with `data-x="-1000"`
        and `data-y="-1500"` attributes. This means that **the center** of the element (yes, the center)
        will be positioned in point x = -1000px and y = -1500px of the presentation 'canvas'. It will not 
        be rotated or scaled.
        
        The "step" class is what *must* be used for every "slide". In this example we also use the "slide"
        class, which adds a rectangle with some background and makes this presentation look like a traditional
        powerpoint slide show. The "slide" class is entirely optional and indeed you wouldn't use it for
        your cooler impress.js presentations.

        <h1>Classes</h1>

        <br /><br /><br />
        <p>Classes let us declare a logical "thing" and encapsulate its properties and logic. Classes are just a special type of functions that we can use like classes in other languages. Similar to how we've created Objects to represent vehicles, we can do this an even cleaner way with classes. As a general best practice, classes begin with an upper case letter.</p>

        <h1>Static vs Instance Properties</h1>
        <br /><br />
        <p>Classes can have both instance and static properties. Instance properties are bound to the this context and require an instance of the class to be referenced. Static properties are bound to the class itself and must be accessed via the class prototype alone - they can not be used on a class instance.</p>

        <h1>Constructors</h1>
        <p>The constructor is a special method that is invoked automatically when a class is instantiated. It is mostly used to initialize the class instance with values, set defaults, do pre-work, etc.</p>

        <pre><code class="javascript">class Vehicle {
    constructor (make, model, year) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;

        <h1>Inheritance</h1>

    constructor(make, model, year, bedLength, towCapacity) {
        super(make, model, year);
        this.bedLength = bedLength;
        this.towCapacity = towCapacity;

        <h1><code>'use strict';</code></h1>

        <p>The 'use strict'; statement at the top of a script indicates that it should be executed in "strict" mode. Strict mode enables a more particular mode that converts what might be a previously allowable developer mistake into an error.</p>

    <!-- This last, empty "slide" is set to be very large using the data-scale attribute, 
         so that it covers all the other slides you just saw. 
         It's a common way of zooming out at the end, to show the whole presentation.
         In CSS, we set pointer-events:none to make this slide non-clickable. 
         It makes a difference at least for SVG content, such as the mermaid diagram. -->
